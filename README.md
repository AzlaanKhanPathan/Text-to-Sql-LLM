# Text-to-SQL Large Language Model (LLM)
Welcome to the Text-to-SQL LLM repository! This project provides a powerful large language model designed to translate natural language queries into SQL queries. It's perfect for applications that require natural language understanding to interact with relational databases seamlessly.

# Features
* Natural Language Understanding: Converts plain English (or other languages) into SQL queries with high accuracy.
* Flexible Querying: Supports complex SQL constructs including JOINs, nested queries, and aggregations.
* Pre-trained Models: Includes pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific domains or use cases.
* Easy Integration: Designed for straightforward integration into applications and tools.
